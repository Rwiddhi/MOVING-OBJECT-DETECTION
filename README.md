# MOVING-OBJECT-DETECTION IN A VIDEO USING DEEP LEARNING
This project uses the YOLOv8 model to detect and identify moving objects in video frames. It combines deep learning with optical flow techniques for precise motion analysis, offering a robust solution for moving object detection.
Features:
YOLOv8 Integration: Leverages the state-of-the-art YOLOv8 model for object detection.
Optical Flow Analysis: Calculates motion dynamics using the Farneback optical flow algorithm.
Customizable Input/Output: Supports input and output paths for video processing.
Real-Time Processing: Detects and highlights moving objects in real-time frames.
